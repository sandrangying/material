    "# An Introduction to Agent-Based Models: Simulating Segregation with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will explore an approach that has become popular in economics: agent-based models. These are models in which agents are assumed to follow very simple behavioural rules. Their interaction, however, yields complex dynamics and sometimes surprising results. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the pioneers of these models is Schelling. He used this approach to study the phenomenon of racial segregation in urban areas, i.e. the fact that neighboroods in large cities tend to become racially homogenous, creating a racial segregation in the urban space. \n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many US cities are extremely racially segregated. People from the same race tend to live in the same neighborood. The map below is from Chicago. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"silver-segregation-hydepark-dot.png\" alt=\"alt text\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: http://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/index.html -->\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a phenomenon that is common to most US cities, and also some European ones. Here is a map of London, showing a similar segregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://blogs.lshtm.ac.uk/news/files/2013/12/ethnic_density.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://blogs.lshtm.ac.uk/news/2013/12/10/mapping-londons-population-by-ethnic-group/\n",
    "\n",
    "How come? This outcome makes people suspect that the residents of those areas are racist. However, since it is a phenomenon which is observed even in more progressive and multicultural areas (i.e. London), there may be some other mechanism at work too. Thomas Schelling, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2005, explained that there is a strong force behined this phenomenon, which is homophily: people tend to hang out with other people with similar characteristics. Schelling modelled this mechanism in a very simple setup, and then showed that, even abstracting from explanations relying on intolerance and racism, we would still get a pretty segregated urban landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "This intuition generated lots of research, and current studies about racial segregation are substantially based on a Schelling model on steroids. With this project, we will build a version of this model, and we will perform some simulations to establish the consequences of playing with parameters' values. \n",

    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model that Schelling developed is very simple. We have some people living in a city, which for simplicity we will assume is rectangular. Each person can live in a location/house in this city (think of it as a little square of land in the rectangle). People can be from one of $ n$ races. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each location can be empty or occupied. For simplicity, we will assume that each house can be occupied by one person only (although we could interpret each agent in this society as a family). Empty houses will be coloured in white. Occupied houses will be colored with the color of the specific race of the person that occupies it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each person cares about the race of the people living in the neighbourhood. A neighbourhood will be composed by the 8 locations/houses/little squares surrounding the house where one person lives. In the following figure, we can see there is one person living in the cell in cyan. The neighbours are the cells in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"CA-Moore.png\" alt=\"alt text\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Schelling assumed that the behaviour of the agents is described by a simple rule: if the ratio of neighbours that belong to your race is lower than a specified threshold, you want to move to another neighbourhood, otherwise you stay where you are. A person that wants to stay is usually said to be satisfied with the location. A person that wants to move is called unsatisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Schelling model starts from an initial distribution of the people in the city, and then checks of each one of them is satisfied or not. All those unsatisfied get moved to an empty location. After a few iterations of this procedure, we usually converge to a stable situation in which everybody is satisfied. \n"
